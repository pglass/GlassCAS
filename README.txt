This is (going to be) a computer algebra system.

This has been tested under Python 3:
    >>> sys.version
    '3.3.0b1 (v3.3.0b1:e15c554cd43e+, Jun 26 2012, 20:30:00) [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)]'
    
demo_calculator.py is a simple calculator to demonstrate current parsing/computational abilities. See parser_definitions.py for all supported functions and operators. Of note:
    '^' is used for exponentiation
    '%' is used for modulus
    'j' is used for the imaginary unit
    'e' is Euler's number
    'pi' is pi
